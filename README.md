# Income-Tax-Calculator

This is part of my Internshala Core java Training Assignment.

so, we create a calculator using concept of java like:
array, method, loop, conditional statement(if-else) etc.


1) Ask for total number of person count whose tax needs to be calculated.

2) Create an array of String to store names. The size of the array should be the 
person count. 

3) Create an array of long to store incomes. The size of the array should be the 
person count. 

4)  When the user enters name, store it in String array of names. 
 Similarly, store incomes in the long array of incomes.
 
5) Create a static method named calculateTax() that accepts two parameters 
1. String name 
2. long income

6) Within calculateTax() method, use IF-ELSE-IF conditional statements 
to calculate the tax keeping in mind the following aspects 
1. If the income is greater than or equal to 3 lacs per annum then the person is 
liable to pay 20% of his income as tax 
2. If the income is greater than or equal to 1 lac per annum but smaller than 3 lacs 
per annum then the person is liable to pay 10% of his income as tax 
3. If the income is smaller than 1 lac per annum then the person is exempted from 
paying tax 

and then print the tax using print statement.
